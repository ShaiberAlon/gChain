breaks(x, ...)
}
\description{
method to extract "breaks" from a gChain mapping genome x to y
ie pairs of positions that are contiguous in y but were non-contiguous in x

returns a GRangesList in genome x containing the location of pairs of positions
that are contiguous in y that were not contiguous in x.

breaks are only defined in one direction (ie x to y)
(if you want to do reverse then just "transpose" the chain, or use rev = TRUE)
